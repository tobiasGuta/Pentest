# packet sniffing
The provided script is a packet sniffer implemented in Python. It listens for incoming network packets on a specified host and extracts relevant information from the IP, TCP, and UDP headers of each packet. The script parses the IP header to retrieve details such as IP version, Time to Live (TTL), protocol, and source/destination IP addresses. Depending on the protocol (TCP or UDP), it further parses the corresponding headers to extract source and destination ports. Additionally, the script includes functionality to parse HTTP payloads specifically. The main function orchestrates the packet sniffing process, capturing and analyzing packets, and printing out the extracted information.
